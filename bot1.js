			<p id="p1">To address the growing need of engineering talent with skills in digital technology, TCS, in partnership with leading academicians across India, has designed a curriculum for 4 years undergraduate program on Computer Science titled â€œComputer Science and Business Systems (CSBS)." This curriculum aims to ensure that the students graduating from the program not only know the core topics of Computer Science but also develop an equal appreciation of humanities, management sciences and human values. The students are also exposed to emerging topics such as Analytics, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things etc. to make them industry ready at the end of four years of study.</p>
